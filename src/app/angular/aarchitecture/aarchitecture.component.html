  Angular is built upon components. The starting point of an Angular app is the bootstrapping of the initial 
  parent component. Much like the html DOM tree that starts with an html element and then branches down from there,
  Angular runs on a component tree model. After Angular loads the first component with the bootstrap call, 
  it then looks within that component's html view and sees if it has any nested components. 
  If so, Angular finds matches and runs the appropriate component code on those.
  This repeats for each component down the tree.<br><br>

  You can even use components within components. This is where the component tree comes into play. 
  Much like how you write html, creating nested elements within elements, you can build out your Angular apps by 
  having components rendering components within their templates. Each component gets configured with a selector, 
  which tells Angular what markup element tag to associate the component class logic with.
  When you build a component in Angular, you are creating a support for a new custom element for the DOM.<br>
  e.g.  &lt;app-root&gt;
  <br><br>
  The three main building blocks are the model, the controller, and the view.  In FigureÂ A, you can see the
  traditional exposition of the MVC pattern as it applies to server-side development.<br><br>

  But in the Angular the pitcure is slidly different. of course, Angular exists in the browser,
   which leads to a twist on the MVC theme, as illustrated in Figure B.
